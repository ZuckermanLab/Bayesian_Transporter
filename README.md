Supporting code for Bayesian Transporter research - still under development. 

### Todo:
- update installation requirements and getting started

### Usage:
for MLE use `run_optimizer.py`, for Bayesian use `run_emcee.py` or `run_pocomc.py`

### Limitations / issues
- parallelization issues with libroadrunner. see: https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/issues/563 
- pocoMC sampler bugs, use my fork with fix. see: https://github.com/minaskar/pocomc/issues/22 and my fork: https://github.com/augeorge/pocomc
